Introduction
The purpose of this assignment is to give you lots of practice working with conditional logic.
For this assignment youâ€™ll create one class called CricketGame that is a simplified model of the
game of cricket.
Whoa, you say, but I don't know anything about cricket. Do not worry, until the day before
yesterday neither did we! We just read about the rules on Wikipedia, made some simplifications,
and wrote up a specification. In the past we have made assignments out of games like baseball
and American football, so this semester we thought we'd level the playing field (haha) for the
non-US students.
As with our previous assignment, all you really need to do is implement the methods as specified
and you'll be fine.
